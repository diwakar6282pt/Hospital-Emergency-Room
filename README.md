# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard that provides a comprehensive monthly overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) for hospital emergency services. The dashboard is intended to help healthcare administrators, managers, and staff monitor and improve ER efficiency, patient care quality, and operational effectiveness.

## KPI	Description

1. Number of Patients-	                    Total number of patients who visited the ER (e.g., 948 patients in April).
2. Average Wait Time-	                    Average time (in minutes) patients waited before being attended (e.g., 34.97 mins).
3. Patient Satisfaction Score-	            Average patient satisfaction rating, likely on a scale (e.g., 4.99 out of 5).
4. Admission Rate-	                        Percentage and count of patients admitted vs not admitted (e.g., 48% admitted).
5. On-Time Attendance Rate-	              Percentage of patients attended on time vs delayed (e.g., 57% on time).
6. Gender Distribution-	                  Percentage of male vs female patients (e.g., 50% male, 50% female).
7. Age Group Distribution-	                Number of patients segmented by age groups (e.g., 0–9, 10–19, ..., 70–79).
8. Department Referral Count-	            Number of patients referred to different hospital departments (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics).
9. Monthly Trend Comparison-	              Selection between yearly data (2023 vs 2024) and monthly navigation (Jan–Dec).

## PROCESS

Collect Data from hospital systems on patients, wait times, satisfaction, and referrals.
Clean and Prepare Data by formatting dates, categorizing age groups, and handling missing values.
Calculate KPIs such as total patients, average wait time, admission rate, and satisfaction score.
Design the Dashboard using charts (bar, pie, cards) to visualize metrics clearly.
Add Filters and Interactivity like month/year selectors for dynamic reporting.
Review with Stakeholders to ensure accuracy and usefulness.
Update Regularly with new data for ongoing performance monitoring.

## INSIGHT

This dashboard gives a clear view of emergency room performance by tracking patient volume, wait times, satisfaction, and admission trends. It helps hospital staff make quick, informed decisions, improve service efficiency, and enhance patient care through real-time, data-driven insights.

## FINAL CONCLUSION

The Hospital ER Dashboard effectively visualizes key metrics to monitor and improve emergency room operations, enabling faster decisions, better resource management, and enhanced patient care.
