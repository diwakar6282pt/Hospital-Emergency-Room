# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard that provides a comprehensive monthly overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) for hospital emergency services. The dashboard is intended to help healthcare administrators, managers, and staff monitor and improve ER efficiency, patient care quality, and operational effectiveness.
